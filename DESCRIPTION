Description: Provides capabilities to install multiple, specific versions of packages side-by-side and load specific versions of packages for use in code.
    This approach is designed to minimize the duplication of 'frozen' libraries on your system while still providing flexibility in what packages are used in what code.
    By 'freezing' the version of a package used with code, the code becomes far more reproducible.  Additionally, the approach taken here makes it explicit which version of a package is being used.
